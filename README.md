# RNN-to-Model-Protein-Sequences

This is a course programming project on recurrent neural networks. The main purpose of the assignment is to apply RNN to model protein sequences. The course is Deep and Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals. 
Due to Github size limit on files, the original data has been truncated to have 50,000 instead of 440,115 protein sequences. The original data is available at

Hopefully, the original data is still available on the same link, if not accidentally removed.
